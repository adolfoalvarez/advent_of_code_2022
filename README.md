# advent_of_code_2022

I will post here my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. You can participate at https://adventofcode.com/

The puzzles can be solved using any programming language. Some people is using the advent of code to learn a new language, and others (like me) to try not to forget their "mother tongue", so this will be in R.

Follow the #AdventOfCode hashtag in Matsodon or in the bird site to find other solutions. I recommend you the Julia language ones from my friend https://github.com/BERENZ at https://github.com/BERENZ/aoc2022
